# socket-chatbot
Basic client(s)/server socket communication

Goal of this project is to learn basic socket communication and explore the python socket library.
After gaining basic functions (server handling multiple clients and client messaging), will run more complex automations for specific use cases
Maybe it might be used as a base for something more complex further down the line.

note: Should really write the tests before the main code
