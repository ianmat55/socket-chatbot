# socket-chatbot
Basic client(s)/server socket communication

Goal of this project is to learn basic socket communication and explore the python socket library.
After gaining basic functions (server handling multiple clients and client messaging), will run more complex automations for specific use cases
Maybe it might be used as a base for something more complex further down the line.

UPDATE: After testing a lot of different directions, this project will be a tcp chat app in terminal.

Server Functions:
kick() - kicks a specific user from chat
ls() - lists active connections
bc() - send msg directly to one client
log() - logs all messages up to when command is called

Both Client and Server:
read() - specify a path to text file and server will read file into chat
cls() - clears terminal
exit() - close connection
help() - print help table
